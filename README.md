# About Fit
Fit utilizes Edamam, and open-source API, and user inputs to provide a detailed and ever-evolving resource for exercises and meal-planning. Logged-in users can browse the meals offered by the database, view exercises that other users have created, and add both to their profile to help stay on track with achieving their fitness goals. In the future, we hope to implement a weekly calendar view and the ability to connect with friends to keep each other accountable and see their progress.
